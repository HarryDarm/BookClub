# BookClub
A whimsical, pastel-themed website for my book club “The Book Was Better,” being built as a passion project to explore front-end web development. Combines my love of books with hands-on learning in UI design, HTML/CSS, and responsive layout.

📚 The Book Was Better – A Book Club Web App
Welcome to my passion project!
This repository tracks the development of a custom-built website for my friends’ and my book club: The Book Was Better. The site is being built from scratch as a way for me to learn front-end web development and create something genuinely useful for our club.

🧠 Project Background
I'm currently a 4th year Software Engineering student at Macquarie University, but web development isn’t something I’ve encountered in my coursework yet. After hearing my mum talk about all the confusion in her own book club—who’s choosing the next book, where they’re meeting, and losing track of what they’ve read—I thought, why not build a solution?

So this project is:

A personal learning journey into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

A real-world solution for our actual book club

A collaborative experiment with friends acting as my user base, testers, and critics

🌟 Features (Planned / In Progress)

✅ MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
 Display current book of the month

 Rotating book picker for members

 Meeting date/location organiser

 History of past reads

 Notes/review section per book

🧪 Future Features

 Login/account-based bookmarking

 Poll for book voting

 Monthly reading progress tracker

 Newsletter/reminder integration

 Responsive mobile design

🛠️ Tech Stack
As a beginner in frontend dev, I’m starting simple and growing from there:

HTML/CSS: Layout and styling

JavaScript: Interactivity and logic

GitHub Pages (future): For hosting

VS Code + Live Server: Dev environment

Tutorial: Traversy Media’s Professional Website From Scratch – using this as my base before spinning off into a fully custom design

💬 Community & Feedback
Since my friends are the primary users, they’ll be suggesting improvements, reporting bugs, and helping identify redundant features as we go. I’ll document changes in the changelog and log major milestones in the Projects section of my LinkedIn.

Feel free to open an issue or send me a message if you want to suggest a feature, tutorials foe me to look into or give advice—especially if you’re a web dev and have thoughts on better ways to structure things!
